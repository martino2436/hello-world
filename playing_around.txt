Hey, Easter Monday now. Still playing around with Git and making a little commit for today :)...
Let's make some changes yay yay yay...
We've branched it mate. Let's see where it brings us.
Yo yo.
I would like to raise a concern on this branch.
It seems sync whit Git. Let's test it. Is it though?
Was working but seems off now. Why?
Man is is working?
Forgot to push lol...
Ok so I think I got it.
Wonder though why the changes are not reflected ready to stage?

Trying again.
on another branch....

let's try something...

Let's try with fetch instead...

Ok I will make some changes in the middlle and see where it brings us...

trying a git commit --amend. it did not work.

Here I am again. This time I will try rebase instead of merge. Concept that I struggle to grasp so far.

Need to start from the master apparently to rebase.

Yo yo what does merge do?
