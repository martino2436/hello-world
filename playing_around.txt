Hey, Easter Monday now. Still playing around with Git and making a little commit for today :)...
Let's make some changes yay yay yay...
We've branched it mate. Let's see where it brings us.
Yo yo.
I would like to raise a concern on this branch.
<<<<<<< HEAD

Was working but seems off now. Why?
Man is is working?
Forgot to push lol...
Ok so I think I got it.
Wonder though why the changes are not reflected ready to stage?
